# VoBoost Config Demo - Project Intelligence

## Language Policy (CRITICAL)
- ALL code comments MUST be in English
- ALL documentation MUST be in English
- ALL variable names, function names, class names MUST be in English
- ALL error messages MUST be in English
- Configuration VALUES can support multiple languages including Russian
- This policy is documented in memory bank and must be maintained

## Naming Convention (CRITICAL)
- Project name is ALWAYS "Voboost" (not "VoBoost")
- Use "Voboost" in all documentation, comments, and user-facing text
- This applies to titles, headers, and any references to the project name

## Project Patterns

### Application Architecture
- MainActivity as single activity demonstrating all library features
- ConfigManager integration following library best practices
- Real-time UI updates using OnConfigChangeListener
- Proper Android lifecycle management with resource cleanup

### File Structure
- Demo app code in src/main/java/ru/voboost/config/demo/
- UI layouts and resources in standard Android res/ structure
- Default configuration in assets/config.yaml
- Independent memory bank documentation in memory-bank/
- All build files use Kotlin DSL (.gradle.kts)

### UI Implementation
- SpannableStringBuilder for dynamic text formatting with color highlighting
- Red color highlighting for changed configuration fields using ForegroundColorSpan
- Monospace font for professional configuration display
- Status messages with color coding (green=success, red=error, blue=update)

### Integration Approach
- voboost-config library as external dependency (project reference or Maven)
- Result pattern for consistent error handling from library
- File operations using Android Context.filesDir for private storage
- Asset copying pattern for default configuration deployment

## Critical Implementation Details

### Real-time Visual Feedback
- Changed configuration fields appear in red color immediately
- Unchanged fields remain in standard black color
- Uses diff parameter from OnConfigChangeListener to determine changes
- Scalable design allows easy addition of new configuration fields

### Configuration Display Pattern
- Load configuration from assets on first run, copy to private directory
- Display all configuration values in hierarchical format
- Real-time monitoring through library's file watching capabilities
- Graceful error handling with user-friendly status messages

### Android Integration
- Proper file system usage with Context.filesDir
- UI thread safety with runOnUiThread for background callbacks
- Resource cleanup in onDestroy() to prevent memory leaks
- Standard Android app structure and conventions

## Build System
- Android application with voboost-config library dependency
- Android Gradle Plugin 8.2.0
- Kotlin 1.9.20
- Minimum API 28 (Android 9)
- Target SDK 34 for latest Android compatibility

## Development Workflow
- Memory bank MUST be updated when discovering new patterns
- All project information MUST be stored in memory bank, not in separate files
- Demo app should always demonstrate latest library features
- UI changes should maintain professional appearance and usability
- All changes should follow Android development best practices

## Information Management Rules
- NEVER create separate documentation files outside memory bank
- All technical details, implementation notes, and project updates go in memory-bank/
- Use memory bank files for all project knowledge preservation
- Keep external files minimal and focused only on immediate technical needs
- Maintain independence from main library's memory bank

## Project Status
- COMPLETE and PRODUCTION READY
- Demonstrates all voboost-config library features
- Professional-quality Android application
- Real-time visual feedback system working
- Comprehensive documentation complete
- Ready for use as integration reference

## Key Success Factors
- Real-time configuration change detection with visual feedback
- Professional Android UI with proper error handling
- Complete library integration example
- Independent project with standalone documentation
- Educational value for developers learning library usage
- Production-ready implementation patterns

## Code Style Rules
- ALL source code files MUST end with a blank line to avoid "No newline at end of file" warnings in diffs
- This applies to .kt, .java, .xml, .yaml, .md and all other text files
- Always add empty line at the end when creating or modifying files
- NO EMOJI in any files - use plain text only for all documentation and code

## Visual Design Patterns
- Red color (#FF0000) for changed configuration fields
- Black color for unchanged configuration fields
- Green color for success status messages
- Red color for error status messages
- Blue color for update notification messages
- Monospace font family for configuration text display
- Rounded background with padding for configuration display area

## Error Handling Patterns
- Use Result pattern from voboost-config library consistently
- Display user-friendly error messages in status text
- Never crash on configuration errors - show error state instead
- Log detailed errors for debugging while showing simple messages to users
- Graceful degradation when configuration files are missing or invalid

## File Operation Patterns
- Copy default config from assets to filesDir on first run
- Use Context.filesDir for all configuration file operations
- Check file existence before operations to avoid crashes
- Proper exception handling for all file I/O operations
- Clean up resources and file watchers in activity lifecycle methods

## UI Thread Safety Rules
- All UI updates MUST happen on main thread using runOnUiThread
- File watching callbacks come from background threads
- Never block UI thread with file operations
- Use proper Android patterns for background-to-UI communication
